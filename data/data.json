      "description": "Caught in a maze of bureaucratic absurdity and colonial remnants, a British-Nigerian filmmaker reassembles their fractured identity through archival images, brutalist architecture, and experimental cinema—interrogating the power and politics of memory.",
      "director_statement": "Growing up as “Peter” in the UK, I came of age at the intersection of administrative fiction and diasporic truth. The moment I received a citizenship letter in someone else’s name, I began an odyssey through bureaucracy—a journey that blurred the line between identity and absurdity. The archive became a mirror and a maze. This film is not only a retelling of that journey, but a confrontation with the very structures that mediate belonging, memory, and meaning. Archives Also Die is my attempt to reclaim voice through form—to juxtapose the rationalist facade of empire with the chaotic, affective, lived realities of postcolonial subjects. I did not want to merely critique the archive from afar, but to live within it—to screen record it, mispronounce its metadata, pixelate its hierarchies, and project it onto the walls of the present. My body and voice carry the friction between my ancestral name—Oluwatosin Oluwakayode Ominiyi Temi Tope Peter Adegoke—and the imposed simplicity of “Peter.” This film insists that representation is not enough. Transformation is necessary. Through tunnels, towers, and terminals, I offer a new passage through history—not to retrieve what was lost, but to reshape what remains.",

      "Director's Statement": "This project began as a modest exploration of historical street furniture: a set of stone benches dotted across the St Paul’s area, their presence anonymous and unremarked. Yet, these stones were extracted from the Thames Embankment wall, a site underpinned—literally—by Victorian engineering, sanitation systems, and layers of forgotten city planning. I found myself drawn to them, not just for what they were, but for what they contained—earth and water, stillness and memory. As I began filming, I worked through a double-diamond process—an approach borrowed from the tech world, where I once worked—which allowed me to ideate expansively before defining, and later to develop freely before distilling. This journey was not linear, but iterative and often uncertain. The core question was always this: how can the inanimate speak? Through image, sound design, and poetic structure, the film seeks to animate what cannot move, and to hold space for what no longer speaks. We follow the benches as portals between past and present, accompanied by soundscapes built from church bells, hydrophones submerged in the Thames, and EQ’d traffic noise woven into the whip pans between locations.",
      "description": "Hidden in plain sight, a set of stone benches in London becomes the vessel for a poetic excavation—where earth meets water, and the static tells a story in motion. Through image, sound, and elemental metaphor, this documentary explores the life of city remnants and their forgotten histories.",
